On linux, execute this command at ~:
```
git clone https://github.com/prdepinho/vim.git .vim
```
That's it for linux.

On windows, the command is like this: 
```
git clone https://github.com/prdepinho/vim.git _vim
```
Then, after installation, move \_vim\\vimrc to your home folder and rename it to \_vimrc.

Optionally, move .tmux.conf to home.
